## AI Suggestions Feature End-to-End Tests

These are end-to-end browser tests don't run automatically with `composer test`.

Like the other tests, make sure the database is initialized and the server is running on your device before running the tests. Instructions are in `docs/Setup.md`, under *Database Setup*.

Then complete the following set up specific to these tests:

### Browser Playwrights
Install the browser playwrights with `npx playwright install` from the `laravel/` directory. This will install mock browsers onto your system, using around 0.5GB of storage. You can remove these after running the tests with `npx playwright uninstall`, and reinstall them later if necessary.

Optional: If you'd like these to install onto a specific drive, follow <a href="https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers#managing-browser-binaries">these configuration steps</a>. However, as of writing this, only the default set up has been tested.

### Docker
Ensure you have docker on your device, with enough space to create a container. The LocalStack container takes around 1GB of system storage. The actual container creation (and deletion) are handled by the script.

Ensure docker is running on your system. You should be able to run `docker ps` without errors.

### Environment Variables
Like for the other tests, make sure to have `.env.testing` set up. You can just copy `.env.testing.example`. Make sure to set `PLAYWRIGHT_VIEWPORT_WIDTH` and `PLAYWRIGHT_VIEWPORT_HEIGHT` to something **smaller** than your screen resolution.

### Running the Test server (and LocalStack)

`cd` into the `python/services/lo_mapping_services` and activate the virtual environment (steps are in *Activate virtual environment* section in `docs/Setup.md`).

Then run `python -m app.test`. 

If the LocalStack container isn't already up and running, this command automatically sets it up and starts it.

### Running the tests 

Run these specific tests with `composer test:ai-suggestions-e2e`.

**Debugging**

To see the browser as the tests run, use `composer test:ai-suggestions-e2e:visual`.
To see the browser and debug-step, use `composer test:ai-suggestions-e2e:debug`.

### Troubleshooting
- If the failure message says 'interrupted by ...', try closing unnecessary processes on your device.
- If the failure message says it could not find a specific element, this could either be a genuine issue to debug, or it could be a viewport issue (see **Environment Variables** section aobve).
- Use `$page->screenshot()` before and after problematic points to see what the page showed.
- Use `$page->debug()` to open a debug stepping browser window at that point. This also skips other tests, so you can get here fast - great for debugging one specific point!

### Notes

- Since LocalStack doesn't currently support SageMaker, we've 'mocked' quite a few tasks in the tests by sending requests to test endpoints. One non-SageMaker function is also mocked - `putPendingRecord()` is used instead of submitting a request via the UI. Submitting via the UI would need us to first deploy the lambda to LocalStack. Calling this lambda would put the pending record in DynamoDB, then call SageMaker and fail with LocalStack, returning an error. So `putPendingRecord()` was chosen. In the future, if we make some sort of mock SageMaker server (this seems viable), then we could deploy the lambdas to LocalStack and make the tests more 'end-to-end' accurate with UI interactions throughout.

- To understand the tests, look at `MainWorkflowTest.php` first. It has a lot of comments to explain what's going on.

- In `MainWorkflowTest.php`, the course, program, and initial mapping setup are done by simulating user clicks to be as realistic as possible. In the other tests, however, these are done programmatically to save time and focus on the actual case being tested (unless setup is relevant to the test case, like in `AddingCLOPLOafterSubmittingTest.php`).

- The tests have `wait()` commands scattered throughout. The wait times were set through trial-and-error. They slow down the tests quite a bit, but make sure that elements needed are loaded, and just overall seem to reduce flakiness.

- When writing tests, start with `visit_v(url)` instead of `visit(url)` to take advantage of the viewport set in `.env.testing`. This prevents some 'element not found' errors. Then you can use `navigate()` to keep the same viewport on that window, or use `visit_v()` again to open a new window.

- In the test LO mapping service (`test.py`), the environment variables are set within the code. This seemed simpler than using an `.env.testing` there, as most of the values don't matter and aren't confidential.
