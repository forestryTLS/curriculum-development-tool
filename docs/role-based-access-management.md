# Role-Based Access Management

## Overview

The Curriculum Mapping Tool uses two layers to determine what a user can access and do:

1. **Role** — a role type assigned to the user (Admin, Department Head, Program Director, or User) that grants broad access to resources (courses, programs, or syllabi) across the system.
2. **Direct collaboration permissions** — explicit access granted on individual courses, programs, or syllabi, regardless of role.

Both layers can apply to the same user at the same time. For example, a Program Director may also be added as a collaborator on a course outside their program, combining both sources of access.

## User Roles

### Admin

Administrators have full system-wide access. They can view and edit all courses and programs across the entire system. Administrators are also the only role that can assign or change roles for other users.

### Department Head

Department Heads can view and edit all courses and programs within their assigned department(s). With some setting during role assignment by admins, a Department Head may also be granted access to all courses across their faculty, beyond their specific department.

### Program Director

Program Directors can view and edit all courses and programs within their assigned program(s). With some setting during role assignment by admins, a Program Director may also be granted access to all courses across their faculty, beyond their specific program.

### User

The User role is the default assigned to any self-registered account. Users can view and edit only the courses and programs they created themselves, or those they have been explicitly added to as a collaborator.

## Collaboration Permissions

Regardless of role, individual courses, programs, and syllabi support direct collaborator access. When a user is added as a collaborator on a resource, they are assigned one of three permission levels:

| Permission | Access |
|------------|--------|
| **Owner** | Full control over the resource |
| **Editor** | Can view and modify content |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access |

When a role (Administrator, Department Head, or Program Director) grants a user access to a resource, that access is treated as **Owner-level**, the same as if they had been explicitly added as an owner collaborator.

## Role Assignment

- New accounts are automatically assigned the **User** role upon self-registration.
- Only **Administrators** can assign or change roles for other users.
